# Calendar Appointment Display Comparison

## Role-Based Calendar (Time Slots View)
- **Display Method**: Time slot grid with appointments in specific time slots
- **Time Slots**: ['08:00', '08:30', '09:00', ..., '18:30'] (22 slots)
- **Appointment Matching**: Uses `normalizeTime()` function to match appointment times to slots
- **Status Colors**: Full status color mapping (10+ statuses)
- **Filters**: Doctor filter dropdown, role-based patient/doctor filtering
- **Appointment Display**: Shows patient name, doctor name (if not doctor view), status badge, priority icon
- **Multiple Appointments**: Takes first appointment if multiple in same slot

## Proper Calendar (Traditional Calendar)
- **Display Method**: Traditional calendar grid with appointments shown as blocks
- **Views**: Month, Week, Day views
- **Time Handling**: Different time slot arrays for different views
  - Week view: ['09:00', '10:00', '11:00', '12:00', '14:00', '15:00', '16:00', '17:00']
  - Day view: ['09:00', '09:30', '10:00', '10:30', ..., '17:30']
- **Status Colors**: Same status color mapping as role-based calendar
- **Appointment Display**: Shows time, patient/doctor name, appointment type, status

## Key Differences Found:

### 1. Time Slot Coverage
- **Role-Based**: 08:00-18:30 (full day coverage)
- **Proper Calendar**: 09:00-17:30 (business hours only)
- **Issue**: Appointments before 09:00 or after 17:30 may not show in Proper Calendar

### 2. Time Slot Granularity
- **Role-Based**: 30-minute intervals throughout
- **Proper Calendar Week View**: 1-hour intervals only
- **Issue**: Appointments at 30-minute marks (e.g., 09:30, 10:30) may not show in week view

### 3. Date Filtering
- Both calendars use the same date filtering logic
- Both should show appointments for the correct dates

### 4. Role-Based Filtering
- **Role-Based**: Filters by doctor_id for doctors, patient_id for patients
- **Proper Calendar**: Only filters by doctor_id for doctors
- **Issue**: Patient view may not work correctly in Proper Calendar

## Potential Issues:
1. **Time Coverage Gap**: Proper Calendar may miss early/late appointments
2. **Granularity Gap**: Week view may miss 30-minute appointments
3. **Role Filter Gap**: Patient filtering may not work in Proper Calendar
4. **Multiple Appointments**: Role-Based only shows first appointment per slot

## Recommended Fixes:
1. âœ… **FIXED** - Standardize time slots across both calendars
