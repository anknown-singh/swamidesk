-- Disable RLS for Custom Authentication Compatibility
-- =====================================================
-- Since the application uses custom authentication with cookies
-- instead of Supabase auth, we need to disable RLS policies
-- that depend on auth.uid() to allow proper data access

-- Keep RLS enabled for sensitive tables but with permissive policies
-- We'll create simple policies that allow access based on service role
-- or create custom functions for the authenticated client
