# üîß Localhost Connection Issue

## Problem Identified ‚ùå
System-level localhost connectivity issue preventing access to Next.js server.

## Quick Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Check macOS Firewall
```bash
sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --getglobalstate
```

### 2. Test Basic Localhost
```bash
ping localhost
```

### 3. Check Hosts File
```bash
cat /etc/hosts | grep localhost
```
Should show: `127.0.0.1 localhost`

### 4. Try Alternative Solutions

**Option A: Use Network IP**
- Server shows: `Network: http://192.168.1.100:3333`
- Try this URL in your browser instead of localhost

**Option B: Use Production Build**
```bash
npm run build
npm start -- --port 3333
```

**Option C: Check Terminal Access**
- The Next.js server IS running (shows "Ready in 1135ms")
- Issue is with localhost resolution/connectivity
- Not a code problem - system configuration issue

### 5. Alternative Testing
Since localhost is blocked, you can:
1. **Run database setup first** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Use the network IP** when it becomes available
3. **Deploy to Vercel** for cloud testing

## Immediate Next Step ‚úÖ
**Go to Supabase SQL Editor** and run the database setup:
```

```

Copy/paste the entire `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` content and click RUN.

Once database is set up, we can try different approaches to access the app!
