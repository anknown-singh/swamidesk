# 🔧 Final Setup Step: Enable GitHub Actions Permissions

## 🚨 Issue Identified

Release-Please is failing with the error: **"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"**

This is a repository security setting that needs to be enabled.

## ✅ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Method 1: Via GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/anknown-singh/swamidesk
2. **Click Settings** (top tab)
3. **Scroll down to "Actions"** in the left sidebar
4. **Click "General"** under Actions
5. **Scroll to "Workflow permissions"**
6. **Select**: ✅ **"Read and write permissions"**
7. **Check**: ✅ **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"**
8. **Click "Save"**

### Method 2: Via GitHub CLI (Alternative)
```bash
# Enable Actions to create PRs
gh api -X PATCH repos/anknown-singh/swamidesk \
  --field allow_auto_merge=false \
  --field delete_branch_on_merge=true \
  --field allow_squash_merge=true \
  --field allow_merge_commit=true \
  --field allow_rebase_merge=true
```
